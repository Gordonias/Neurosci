First, let think about why this \"standard scaling\" (substracting the mean, dividing by std) is important? You will be combining data from different participants for these exercises. They have been possibly recorded at different days, with different gels or electrodes, and thus with different conductivity between participants. We will assume that the recording across trials within one participant remains stable. So, in order to compare and average the recordings from different participants \"fairly\", we want them to be on more or less the same scale.\n",

    "We can thus attempt to normalize the signal per participant, by dividing all data per participant by its standard deviation. Let's show the extent of the problem by plotting the participants with the lowest and highest std side by side. Re-create your matrix of std values for the evoked period, but:\n",
    "- do not subset one participant, but retain all participants (still only selecting 1 channel)\n",

    "- use np.argmax (and variants) to create two indexes, min_std and max_std that point to the participants with the lowest and highest standard deviations\n",

By doing this, we reduce the time-resolved powerspectrum for the baseline period to a single (average) baseline powerspectrum.

    "As you can see from fig Q8A, there are still substantial differences in the overall powerspectrum power between the lines representing different trials, and in lines from different participants. This is because we have normalized the EEG traces within participants by their standard deviation, but not necessarily between participants. Some participants might just show more beta power (for example) than others. Rather, we are interested in power *changes* in comparison to a baseline. We will consider, for each trial, the extracted baseline powerspectrum that you just extracted, and normalize the power spectrum of all windows that fall into the evoked period by this baseline spectrum. \n",
    "Any frequencies with *more* power than the baseline will have values above 1, frequencies with *less* power will have values lower than 1. \n",
