First, let think about why this \"standard scaling\" (substracting the mean, dividing by std) is important? You will be combining data from different participants for these exercises. They have been possibly recorded at different days, with different gels or electrodes, and thus with different conductivity between participants. We will assume that the recording across videos within one participant remains stable. So, in order to compare and average the recordings from different participants \"fairly\", we want them to be on more or less the same scale.\n",
